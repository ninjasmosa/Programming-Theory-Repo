## Inheritance

There will be a number of shapes. Presssing keys will make them move or jump. Each shape is different to another.

## Polymorphism

All shapes will be able to move. Some will be able to move faster or jump higher than others.

## Encapsulation

Speed values and shape types should be of a valid type and of a correct value. e.g, speeds cannot be negative.

## Abstraction

Move and Jump functions can be kept in their own functions.
